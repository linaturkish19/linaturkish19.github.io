       <p>
           <span>a b o u t</span>Flower is a modified shoot with condensed axis called thalamus and appendages called floral organs.
           Stamens (microsporophylls) and carpels (megasporophylls) represent the essential parts of a flower.
           ADVERTISEMENTS:
           Thus flower is a shoot bearing sporophyll. 
          Flowering plants have successfully colonised land by reducing the water dependent gametophytic generation to the point where it is entirely protected within the sporophytic generation.
           Typically flower is a condensed branch in which internodes have become condensed,
          bringing the nodes close to one another, and the leaves are modified to form floral whorls that directly or indirectly participate in the process of reproduction.
           Flowers differ considerably in size, shape, colour and arrangement of their parts, yet most of them bear a common structural plan.  </p>
